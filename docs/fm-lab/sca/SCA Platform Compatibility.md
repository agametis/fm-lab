# SCA Platform Compatibility

**Rubric:** [Static Code Analysis](../Wiki/Static%20Code%20Analysis.md) · 19 bundles · `rest-api/templates/dashboards-custom/static-code-analysis/platform/`

The platform rubric answers deployment questions from documentation evidence instead of trial and error. It covers **two orthogonal axes** — *compatibility* ("can this run under environment X?") and *platform binding* ("was this built for X?") — plus the operating-system sub-axis ("does this assume macOS / Windows / Linux / iOS?"). Every statement traces back to curated reference data: the Claris step-compatibility table and OS-affinity curation in [fm-spec](../Wiki/fm-spec.md), and the vendor platform flags in [plugin-spec](../schema/plugin-spec.md) — never guessed from names.

## When to use it

- Before hosting scripts on FileMaker Server, exposing them via Data API/OData/WebDirect, or shipping to FileMaker Go — the compat members list every step and plug-in call that won't survive the move.
- Planning a migration to a **Linux-based** FileMaker Server: the Linux-readiness view consolidates exactly the delta that works on macOS/Windows servers but not on Linux.
- Understanding a solution's shape: the binding and OS-profile views show what the solution was *built for*, which explains compat findings instead of just counting them.

## Reading the results

The two axes must not be confused. **Compatibility** members are checks (`warning`): steps marked *No* are errors, *Partial* are warnings — and in the Claris source, an empty statement means *Partial: conditionally supported*, never "undocumented". Plug-in compat members add the vendor's binary flags, including the Server × OS refinement (functions that run on the server, but not on Linux). FileMaker Go is special: it supports no plug-ins at all, from any vendor. **Binding** members are neutral inventories (`info` or chipless) — an iOS-bound script failing the Server check is not broken; it was built for another platform. On the OS axis, `ios` always means the operating system (hosting both FileMaker Go and iOS SDK apps), never the Go runtime; and absence of an OS statement means "Claris states nothing", never "runs everywhere". These bundles double as members of the platform [Analysis Tests](../Wiki/Analysis%20Tests.md), where per-environment runs build the step × environment matrix.
