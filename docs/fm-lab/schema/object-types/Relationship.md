# Relationship

Part of the [FileMaker object types](FileMaker%20Object%20Types.md) · semantic object-type reference

A **relationship** is an edge of the relationship graph, connecting two [table occurrences](TableOccurrence.md) through one or more **join predicates** — each predicate compares a field of the left side with a field of the right side under an operator. Per side, the relationship additionally carries the cascade options (*allow creation of related records*, *delete related records*) and an optional **sort definition** that orders the related set, including the *custom sort by value list* case.

Relationship is an **exported** type with two catalog particularities. First, [RelationshipCatalog](../catalog-tables/RelationshipCatalog.md) stores **one row per join predicate**, numbered by `Predicate_Index` — a multi-field join therefore spans several rows, and counting relationships means grouping by `Rel_ID` and `File_Name`. Second, the export's `<Relationship>` has no name, so the importer registers it in [ObjectCatalog](../object-catalog/ObjectCatalog.md) under a synthesized identity: `Object_UUID` follows the pattern `rel_<id>_<file>` and `Object_Name` reads `<left occurrence> → <right occurrence>`; the export's own `<UUID>` element is not carried over.

## Properties

Properties marked **not extracted** are visible in the raw XML only.

### Identity

| Property (XML) | In catalog | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `@id` | `Rel_ID` | Shared by all predicate rows of the relationship; unique per file only |
| `<UUID>` (text + attributes) | — | **Not extracted** — [ObjectCatalog](../object-catalog/ObjectCatalog.md) identifies the relationship by the synthesized `rel_<id>_<file>` key instead |
| `<TagList>` | — | Object tags — **not extracted** |

### Sides (`<LeftTable>` / `<RightTable>`)

Every side-level property lands in a `Left_*` or `Right_*` column of the same predicate rows.

| Property (XML) | In catalog | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `@type` | — | Side type (e.g. `Local`) — **not extracted** |
| `@cascadeCreate` | `Left_Create` / `Right_Create` | *Allow creation of records via this relationship* |
| `@cascadeDelete` | `Left_Delete` / `Right_Delete` | *Delete related records when a record is deleted* |
| `<TableOccurrenceReference>` `@id` / `@name` / `@UUID` | `Left_TO_ID` / `Left_TO_Name` / `Left_TO_UUID` (resp. `Right_*`) | → `left_table` / `right_table` links |

### Sort definition (`<SortSpecification>` per side, optional)

| Property (XML) | In catalog | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `@value` | `Left_Sort_Enabled` / `Right_Sort_Enabled` | `NULL` when the side has no sort specification |
| `@maintain` | — | **Not extracted** |
| `<Sort>/@type` | — | Sort direction (`Ascending`, …; `Custom` = by value list) — **not extracted** as such, see below |
| `<PrimaryField><FieldReference>` (per `<Sort>`) | `Left_Sort_Fields` (comma-separated names) + `Left_Sort_Field_UUIDs` / `_Field_IDs` / `_Field_TO_UUIDs` arrays (resp. `Right_*`) | → `sort_field` links (subrole `left` / `right`) |
| `<ValueListReference>` (inside a `Custom` sort) | `Left_Sort_ValueList_UUIDs` / `Right_Sort_ValueList_UUIDs` | → `sorts_by_valuelist` links (subrole `left` / `right`) |

### Join predicates (`<JoinPredicateList>`)

| Property (XML) | In catalog | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `@membercount` | — | Derivable as `max(Predicate_Index)` per relationship |
| `<JoinPredicate>/@type` | `Operator` | Comparison operator — see [Enumerations](#enumerations) |
| Predicate order | `Predicate_Index` | 1-based document order |
| `<LeftField><FieldReference>` `@id` / `@name` / `@UUID` | `Left_Field_ID` / `Left_Field_Name` / `Left_Field_UUID` | → `left_field` link |
| `<LeftField>…<TableOccurrenceReference>` | `Left_Field_TO_Name` / `Left_Field_TO_UUID` | The occurrence context of the compared field |
| `<RightField>` (same structure) | `Right_Field_*` | → `right_field` link |

## References

A relationship is a pure source: it references its two occurrences, the compared fields and any sort fields/value lists — nothing in the catalog points at a relationship (lookups, GTRR and portals reference the [TableOccurrence](TableOccurrence.md), not the edge).

### Outgoing links (Relationship as source)

| Link_Role | Target | Kind | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `left_table` / `right_table` | [TableOccurrence](TableOccurrence.md) | usage | The occurrences forming the two sides |
| `left_field` / `right_field` | [Field](Field.md) | usage | Join-predicate field of the respective side (one pair per predicate) |
| `sort_field` | [Field](Field.md) | usage | Sort field of a relationship side (subrole `left` / `right`) |
| `sorts_by_valuelist` | [ValueList](ValueList.md) | usage | Custom sort order by value list (subrole `left` / `right`) |

### Incoming links (Relationship as target)

## Enumerations

Values marked *(corpus)* are the literals observed in the ooe-fm test corpus; the XML literal set beyond them is not independently documented.

| Property | Values |
|---|---|
| `Operator` (`JoinPredicate/@type`) | `Equal` *(corpus)* — FileMaker's operator set additionally covers the not-equal, less/greater(-or-equal) comparisons and the Cartesian cross join |
| `Sort/@type` | `Ascending` *(corpus)*; `Custom` carries the sort-by-value-list case — the descending literal was not observed |

## Schema & tooling

- **XML schema:** [XML RelationshipCatalog](../../xml/catalogs/XML%20RelationshipCatalog.md) — `Structure/AddAction` branch, one `<Relationship>` per graph edge
- **DB schema:** [RelationshipCatalog](../catalog-tables/RelationshipCatalog.md) (one row per join predicate)
- **Detail view template:** `rest-api/templates/sql/object_details_relationship.sql` (served via the [/api/get-details endpoint](../../rest-api/endpoints/Objects%20API.md))
- **Frontend:** object list at `http://localhost:5173/?type=Relationship`
