-- Comment steps in scripts that carry a TODO marker — planned or optional
-- work. Part of the "Unfinished Work" rule family; the detector is the canon
-- of tools/tests/rules/unfinished_work_detector.sql:
--
--   TODO: (?i)(\bto[\s\-_]?do|\btbd\b|\bto[\s\-_]be[\s\-_](done|defined)\b)
--
-- The TODO family deliberately has NO trailing word boundary — otherwise real
-- markers such as "###--- TO DOs ---###" fall out. The leading \b is
-- mandatory, so prose ("today", "into doing", "stop") does not match.
--
-- Severity is info (traffic light: neutral): a TODO is an inventory figure,
-- not a defect. The defect half of the family is script_comment_fixme.
--
-- Source column is StepsForScripts.Comment_Text — the decoded comment text the
-- converter extracts for Step_ID 89; Comment_Text exists for step 89 only.
--
-- Grain: one finding per comment step. A comment carrying TODO *and* FIXME is
-- reported by both rules of the family — the overlap is intended.
--
-- Deep link: the row click opens the script, scrolls to the comment step
-- (`step`) and marks it (`marks`).
