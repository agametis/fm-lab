-- Version violations against the user-selected installed plugin version.
-- Active only when a version is chosen in the header select (neutral entry =
-- empty param = no check, empty result). The catalog knows no installed
-- plugin version - the selection is the user's honest statement, never an
-- assumption. Same evidence and resolution as data/summary.sql - keep the
-- CTEs in sync. Comparison always runs on since_version_num (major*1000 +
-- minor), never on the version string. An unparseable selection degrades to
-- "no check" plus a single info hint row.
