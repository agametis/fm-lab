-- Variable names containing spaces. FileMaker accepts them in the name field of
-- Set Variable, but every read has to use the ${name with spaces} notation —
-- a plain $name with spaces silently reads a different variable. Translated
-- from fmCheckMate BadVariableNames.
--
-- Deep link: the row click jumps to the script and marks every step that
-- touches the variable — writes and reads alike, because both sides are where
-- the notation matters. `step` is the scroll anchor (first occurrence),
-- `marks` carries the whole set as literal step UUIDs. Step UUIDs come from
-- StepsForScripts; VariableUsages carries the SCRIPT in Context_UUID, not the
-- step.
