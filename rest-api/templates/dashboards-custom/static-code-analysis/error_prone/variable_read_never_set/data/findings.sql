-- Variables that are read although nothing in the catalog ever writes them.
-- Either the write side was renamed or removed, or the value is expected to
-- arrive from somewhere the export does not cover. Translated from fmCheckMate
-- VarsUndefined.
--
-- Let() definitions are excluded outright: a Let variable is defined and read
-- inside the same formula, so the import records it as a read without a
-- matching write — on a large solution that class alone is roughly five times
-- the size of the real finding set and would drown it.
--
-- Scope: local variables are confined to their own script, globals are counted
-- file-wide — which is exactly the scope FileMaker gives a $$ variable. A
-- global written in one script and read in another is therefore no finding.
--
-- `also_set_in` counts the OTHER files whose catalog writes the same name. A
-- high number means the reading side assumes a value crossing file boundaries,
-- which FileMaker's per-file scope does not provide — a different (and usually
-- more interesting) defect than a plain typo.
--
-- Deep link: reads inside script steps jump to the script, with `step` as the
-- scroll anchor and `marks` highlighting every reading step. Reads that only
-- happen in a custom function, a field calculation or a layout object have no
-- step at all; those rows navigate to that object instead (layout objects via
-- their layout plus `ref`, the pattern the layout rules use).
