-- OData platform check. Claris publishes NO per-step OData column - the step
-- base is BORROWED from the 'server' column (OData runs scripts as server-side
-- scripts; the derivation is stated in every message), plus the OData rules
-- that ARE derivable from the catalog: script naming (no leading digit, no
-- special characters) and Commit Records/Requests at the end of data-changing
-- scripts. Never invent an 'odata' column.
-- Source: reference/fm_spec.duckdb -> step_compat/script_steps via ATTACH 'ref'.
-- The three rule branches are UNIONed; DuckDB only allows plain column
-- references in a set operation's ORDER BY, so the union lives in a FROM
-- clause and the severity ranking orders the outer SELECT.
