-- OS binding via Claris builtin functions (axis b, OS sub-axis - inventory,
-- not defects). Source: ref.function_os_affinity (fm_spec >= 1.13.0) - a
-- CURATED, SPARSE set from the Claris help prose; absence of a row means "no
-- Claris statement", never "runs everywhere". Only the binding classes feed
-- findings: 'exclusive' (ComputeModel: macOS+iOS) and source-true inverse
-- 'unsupported' rows (resolved against all four OS - functions have no
-- compat table, the calc engine exists on every OS through some runtime).
-- 'variant' rows (Tranche 2: path formats, window geometry, ...) are doc
-- knowledge -> fm-spec badge only; 'os_probe' rows (Get(SystemPlatform), ...)
-- are the guard idiom -> context evidence, never a binding (E1 territory).
-- 'ios' is the OPERATING SYSTEM (FileMaker Go and iOS SDK apps), never the
-- Go runtime chip. Resolution and CF transitivity follow the v5 function
-- member (platform_specific_ios): locale-tolerant name lookup, calls_function
-- edges, recursive CF closure with a path guard against cycles.
