-- OS binding via Claris script steps (axis b, OS sub-axis - inventory, not
-- defects). Source: ref.step_os_affinity (fm_spec >= 1.13.0) - a CURATED,
-- SPARSE set distilled from the Claris help prose (there is no structured
-- Claris OS table); absence of a row means "no Claris statement", never
-- "runs everywhere". OS vocabulary is strictly macos|windows|linux|ios
-- ('ios' = the operating system, hosting both FileMaker Go and iOS SDK apps);
-- runtime terms never appear here.
--   exclusive   - the step works only on the listed OS (Perform AppleScript).
--   unsupported - Claris names an OS it does NOT work on (Dial Phone: macOS);
--                 stored source-true inverse and resolved against the HOST OS
--                 of the step's runtimes (step_compat x runtime_os_matrix,
--                 'Partial'/NULL counts as potentially running) - never
--                 against all four OS (Dial Phone => windows+ios, not linux).
--   variant     - runs everywhere with OS-dependent behavior; Tranche 2 stays
--                 out of the findings (fm-spec badge only) EXCEPT step 57
--                 Send Event: one step id with two OS-exclusive option sets
--                 (a macOS configuration does nothing useful on Windows and
--                 vice versa) - the single variant with a findings row.
-- Severity is always 'info': findings are neutral properties (v5 convention),
-- never defects; nothing here colours a traffic light.
