-- OS-bound scripts result list of the platform profile tile (v7.1): one row
-- per script, aggregated over the three evidence sources of the
-- platform-os-binding set (Claris steps / builtin functions / plug-in
-- functions). Keep the per-source cores in sync with data/os_summary.sql
-- (same union) and the member bundles.
-- @params: file (optional), os (optional: macos|windows|linux|ios - the
-- KPI-tile filter; a desktop-only script matches both macos and windows),
-- limit (optional, default 500)
