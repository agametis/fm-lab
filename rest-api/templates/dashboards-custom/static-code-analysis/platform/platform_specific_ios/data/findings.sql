-- Platform-binding inventory (axis b): scripts built FOR FileMaker Go (iOS).
-- Neutral by design: findings are properties, not defects — severity is always
-- 'info', the result state stays neutral and never colours a traffic light.
-- Two evidence sources, one row per occurrence:
--   step     — iOS-exclusive script steps, derived from ref.step_compat with a
--              strict exclusivity predicate (go = true AND every other runtime
--              column strictly false; NULL = Partial elsewhere disqualifies).
--              No hard-coded step-id list: the predicate follows future
--              fm_spec versions automatically.
--   function — iOS-dedicated builtin functions (curated affinity list):
--              callable everywhere, meaningful results only on iOS — called
--              directly OR transitively through custom functions (a CF that
--              wraps GetSensor makes its calling scripts iOS-dedicated too;
--              the feature text names the CF the script actually calls).
-- Script-level `binding` = strongest evidence class: exclusive > dedicated.
