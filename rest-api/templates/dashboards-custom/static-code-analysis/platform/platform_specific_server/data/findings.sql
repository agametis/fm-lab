-- Platform-binding inventory (axis b): scripts built FOR FileMaker Server.
-- Neutral by design: findings are properties, not defects — severity is always
-- 'info', the result state stays neutral and never colours a traffic light.
-- Evidence is CONTEXT, not features: there is no server-exclusive step or
-- function, so "built for Server" is derived as "is the target of a
-- Perform Script on Server callsite (steps 164/210)" — the derivation is
-- stated in every message (same convention as the borrowed OData base).
--
-- Since schema 1.20.0 this is fully structured — NO Step_XML regex:
--   resolved — designed targets from XMLStepReferences (per-callsite P2
--              extraction), target identity/file decided by the
--              calls_script edge with Link_Subrole 'on_server' /
--              'on_server_callback' (P4 resolution ladder: declared data
--              sources, prefer-local — resolves declared cross-file targets
--              the old file-internal join had to leave unresolved).
--   external — designed target without a catalog resolution (file not
--              imported); the declared data source name is shown when known.
--   dynamic  — "By name" mode: the target expression is the step's
--              CalculationsCatalog instance (Source_Path 'Step/List'),
--              computed at runtime.
--   empty (unconfigured) callsites have neither row and are skipped.
-- Callsite granularity keeps the enabled-steps convention (Is_Enabled).
