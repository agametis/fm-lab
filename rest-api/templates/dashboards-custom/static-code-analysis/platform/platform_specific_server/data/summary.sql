-- Hand-maintained wrapper embedding the findings core of rule (platform_specific_server).
-- The core is a textual copy — keep filters (file filter + S-Block) in sync with
-- data/findings.sql. Core metric is script_count (unit "scripts"): the goal is
-- script identification, not occurrence counting — the dedicated unit keeps the
-- folder/traffic-light consolidation sums clean (results.service only sums
-- within one unit; platform-bound scripts must never mix with error findings).
-- Every target row counts as one script (resolved, external or dynamic — a
-- dynamic row IS a server-executed script, just not statically identifiable).
-- exclusive/dedicated stay 0 here (no such signal source for Server) — the
-- columns are kept for a uniform summary shape across the specific bundles.
