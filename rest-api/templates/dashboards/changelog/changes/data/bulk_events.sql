-- Mass events with objects matching the filters in the period, newest first —
-- listed whether the list hides them or not. objects/files count the matching
-- objects, objects_total the whole event. from_at/to_at (to the second) open the
-- event's window in the list with bulk=include; the volatile Bulk_Event_ID never
-- leaves the query. scope/kind are canonical English, translated as badges.
-- >>> shared filter block — identical in every dataset of the Changelog dashboards
-- (unit test dashboard-changelog-blocks guards it); change it in all files at once.
--   params    URL params, normalised ('' and absent → NULL / default). `type` and
--             `file` are comma-separated lists of the multi-selects (a handful of
--             values, hence list_contains). `count` and `stack` steer only the charts.
--   stamps    every change stamp with the person (curated aliases of
--             v_change_meta_authors) and the curated technical flag
--   anchor    "data" (default): newest individual change by a developer — the
--             solution's data state; "today": the current local time
--   period    lower bound of the period `days` (7 | 30 | 90 (default) | 365 | all)
--             counted back from the anchor; NULL for all
--   win       from/to (a drill-down window, inclusive) wins over the period
--   base      every filter except time and mass events; Account/Authorization only
--             when the type filter names them (runtime changes, not developer activity)
--   scoped    base within the window
--   charted   base within the period, ignoring the drill-down window — the charts
--             keep their frame while the list shows one of their cells
--   filtered  scoped minus mass events unless `bulk=include`
