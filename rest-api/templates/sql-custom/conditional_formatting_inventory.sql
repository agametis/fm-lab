-- @title: Conditional formatting inventory
-- @description: Every conditional-formatting rule on a layout object, with its enabled state, operator, operands, formula and a generic description of the applied format. Conditional formatting is invisible in Layout mode, so this inventory is the only place the rules become readable side by side — which is where duplicated conditions, disabled leftovers and colour rules nobody remembers become visible. Inspired by the fmCheckMate check "ListConditionalFormatting" — https://github.com/mrwatson-de/fmCheckMate-XSLT

--
-- v2.0 reads LayoutObjectConditions, the rule catalog parsed at import
-- (schema 1.25.0) — the XML-regex extraction with its mandatory leaf filter
-- is gone. The catalog is anchored to the owning object at parse depth, so
-- containers that carry their own rules AND children (e.g. a tab panel) are
-- included; the old leaf filter silently dropped those. Solutions converted
-- before schema 1.25.0 lack the table and report a schema drift until they
-- are re-converted.
--
-- `object_type` (column and chips) is the LayoutObject SUBTYPE (Button,
-- Edit Box, …), not ObjectCatalog.Object_Type — name kept for continuity.
--
-- A rule is active when bit 0 (ENABLE) of Options_Raw is set.
--
-- `operator`/`operands` render only for value-based rules (Condition_Kind
-- 'value'; @type matrix 1-13). Formula rules keep them empty — their
-- condition is the formula itself. A stale Range_Start/End can survive on a
-- formula rule when its type was switched in the editor, so the kind gates
-- the columns, not the presence of a range.
--
-- `format` is a coarse, property-level summary of Local_CSS ("bold, fill
-- color, text color"). v2.1 mirrors the two authority models of the C3 CSS
-- parser (rest-api/src/utils/cf-css.js): colours, font family and font size
-- count only when their Options bit says they were actively chosen (bit 1
-- text colour, 2 fill colour, 3 family, 4 size, 7 icon colour) — the rule
-- dialog serialises those properties as baseline state even when unchecked
-- (font-family/12pt-size travel with every use of the Textformat dialog).
-- The bit-less style toggles count by presence. Unknown properties fall back
-- to their raw CSS name instead of being dropped. `box-shadow: none`
-- accompanies most fill changes as serialisation noise and is excluded —
-- except when it is the rule's only declaration, which renders as 'shadow'.
-- The full CSS parsing (values, swatches) lives in the C3 parser; this SQL
-- derivation stays deliberately label-only because custom-query rows pass
-- through the generic template pipeline untouched (no per-query JS
-- post-processing). Labels are English on purpose — query output is
-- locale-independent.
--
-- The object-type chips switch SERVER-SIDE (`@chip_param: object_type`) over
-- the whole scope. `_chip_facets` counts over `base` — every filter EXCEPT the
-- object type itself, otherwise each chip would only ever show its own
-- selection — while `_row_total` counts over `sel`, i.e. WITH that filter, so
-- the header names the truncation and only then.
