-- @title: Layout object overlaps
-- @description: Pairwise overlaps between sibling objects on a layout, with stack order and overlap area, largest area first. An inventory, not a defect list — most overlaps are deliberate design (a text on its background rectangle, a graphic inside a grouped button). The telling cases are congruent pairs of the same type and large objects fully covered by a sibling. The relation chips filter server-side across the whole scope, as do same_type and min_overlap_pct (default 10 %, hiding objects that merely graze each other).

-- Pairing rule, deliberately identical to the stacked-duplicate rule: objects
-- are compared only against their SIBLINGS — same layout, same parent container
-- and same part. Coordinates are parent-relative, so comparing across nesting
-- levels would be meaningless. Tab panels and popover panels are excluded
-- entirely: they occupy the same rectangle as their neighbours by definition.
-- Keeping the criteria in sync means the stacked-duplicate rule is exactly the
-- `relation = identical` + `same_type = 1` slice of this inventory.
--
-- `overlap_pct` relates the intersection to the SMALLER of the two objects,
-- which is what makes it readable: 100 % means the smaller object is completely
-- covered by (or congruent with) the larger one.
--
-- Ordering is by overlap AREA, not by percentage: a large object buried under
-- a sibling matters more than a tiny one covered to 100 %. It also keeps the
-- loaded page mixed across all three relations instead of filling it with
-- 100 % pairs, which is what makes the page itself readable.
--
-- `min_overlap_pct` defaults to 10: below that, objects are neighbours that
-- graze each other rather than a stack (measured on a large solution, roughly
-- one pair in six is such a graze). The self-join itself is cheap — well under
-- a second over 165k objects — so no layout filter is enforced; scope, the
-- filters and the limit shape the result instead.
--
-- The relation chips switch SERVER-SIDE (`@chip_param: relation`) and carry the
-- true counts of the whole scope — which matters here more than anywhere else,
-- since 93k pairs against a 500-row page would otherwise turn the chips into a
-- sample of half a percent. `_chip_facets` counts over `base` — every filter
-- EXCEPT the relation itself, otherwise each chip would only ever show its own
-- selection — while `_row_total` counts over `sel`, i.e. WITH that filter, so
-- the header names the truncation and only then.
--
-- Row click highlights BOTH partners: `ref` carries the first object (which
-- also drives the origin pill and its dismiss/ESC path), `marks` adds the
-- second one as a literal UUID. The detail view unions the two into one
-- highlight set — an overlap only makes sense when you see both objects.
