-- @template_type: report
-- @description: Structured detail of a Relationship — two TO boxes, per-predicate join conditions, cascade-create/delete + record-sort options per side
-- @params: uuid (required)  — composite Object_UUID  "<Rel_ID>_<File_Name>"
-- @output_format: json
-- @author: Marcel
-- @version: 1.0
-- @tags: relationship, join, predicates, graph
-- @note: Flat rows with a `section` discriminator:
--          'meta'      → one row, relationship-level scalars (TO names/uuids, cascade flags,
--                        sort config per side, composed name). predicate_* are NULL.
--          'predicate' → one row per join predicate (Predicate_Index order); left/right field
--                        name+uuid + operator. relationship-level cols are NULL.
--        RelationshipCatalog carries one row per predicate since schema 1.2.0; the meta row
--        picks any single predicate row (cascade/sort cols are constant per relationship).
